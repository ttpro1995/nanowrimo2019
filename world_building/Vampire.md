# Vampire

There is the virus give its victim similar characteristic of "vampire" in folklore. Although people called them "vampire", it is not so sure if it was really "vampire" as folklore mention. 

## Transmission

- Only human can become the carrier of virus.

- Saliva (low) and bloodstream (high) of the infected contain virus. 

- Inject virus into bloodstream 100% chance victim is infected, no matter the concentrate of virus, a single cell is enough to start the infection.

- Virus can infect on contact on body, depend on how thin the skin and level of virus concentration. If the skin of that point of contact is thick enough and no virus get into bloodstream, the victim is not infected.

- Level of virus in bloodstream determine the effect of virus on the infected.

Example of infection:
    - A victim being bite by the infected: virus from saliva mix with bloodstream, 100% chance of infection
    - A victim touch vampire blood with leather glove (he makes sure the blood does not touch his skin) 0% chance of infection
    - A victim touch vampire blood with bare hand, he has low risk of infection. 
    - A victim touch vampire blood with bare hand and taste the blood, 99% chance of infection

## Power and characteristic 

This section explain what the virus give victim.

### power
Not require train: 
- Strength
- Dexterity
- Endurance 
- All 5 sense 
- Immortality and not aging: They are not become older and die by old age. However, thay can be killed, starved to death, 
- Regeneration: Heal wound faster, however not immediately, can regrow lost limb given time. Blood clotted quickly to prevent blood lost. 
- Resilience: Hard to be killed, can survive a wound that should kill average human many time. Resist to most poison, disease, 

The power (Strength, Dexterity, Endurance) is never so-called superpower, however give an average vampire an edge over normal human in every life. A well trained person (as Van Helsing) or group of people can subdued an average vampire. 

However, a vampire which is trained to specialize use their power is deadly.


Must require train to use the power: 
- Magic <br>
For a normal person to be trained into a mage, wizard, he must inherited magic potential. However, all vampires have magic potential that can be trained into mage or wizard.

Can eat any food ediable by normal human.

Vampires have high effiency in consumsing, digesting blood. However, it is not required as vampire can survive and stay healthy on any food consume by normal people.


## Population control mechanism 
This section explain why the world is not filled with vampire. 


### Mortality rate
There are a chance that the infected will died in few hours BEFORE receive any vampirist power. Nobody have this knowledge unless they try, knowledge come with great cost of lives. 

Male: mortality rate is lower as older they are. Below age 10 is high (99%), At 12 and onward, mortality rate is at minimum, around 25%.

Female: Sure dead after 18. High (99%) for age below 5. Minimum at 10 to 14, at rate 30%.

Purpose: 

- Make the idea of turning someone to vampire is risky, abuse vampire power for wound, disease healing (use Regeneration and Resilience), keeping VIP, love one stay alive (Immortality)
- Control the demographic of vampire: consist of mainly adult male, with small percentage of young (unmature, not breedable) female.

### The beast within

This happen after the infected passed "Mortality check" and gained vampirist power. The infected feels the urging to make a kill (prefer human, then mammal) and suck blood from victim. Giving blood to the victim does not satisfy the thrist, and victim unlikely to take given blood when they are in unconscious, beast-like status.
